### 🐱 Logistic Regression on Cat Classifier 
Binary image classifier to distinguish **cats** from **non-cats** using Logistic Regression.

- 🧠 Built using only **NumPy** – no ML libraries!
- 📦 Dataset: Cat/non-cat images.
- 🔄 Includes forward & backward propagation, and gradient descent.

📂 Folder: `Logistic Regression`
