## 📁 Project Structure

### 📌 Gradient Descent on Dataset
Implementing **Linear Regression** using Gradient Descent to predict housing prices (based on the Ames dataset).

- 🚀 Trains a model from scratch.
- 📉 Visualizes learning curves.
- 📊 Evaluates with metrics like RMSE.

📂 Folder: `Gradient Descent on Dataset`

### 🐱 Logistic Regression
Binary image classifier to distinguish **cats** from **non-cats** using Logistic Regression.

- 🧠 Built using only **NumPy** – no ML libraries!
- 📦 Dataset: Cat/non-cat images.
- 🔄 Includes forward & backward propagation, and gradient descent.

📂 Folder: `Logistic Regression`

### 🔵 Planar Classification
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to classify non-linearly separable **planar datasets**.

- 📈 Uses sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy.
- 🧩 Learns complex decision boundaries.
- 🎨 Includes visualizations of decision boundaries and accuracy progression.
